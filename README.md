# LazySlideshow
A lazy way to turn old tablets or phones into digital photo frames.

The idea behind this project is to simply turn my tablet that hangs on my wall over my monitor into a gallery.
The reason for this is to remind myself daily of the goals I am trying to achieve, a form of manifestation.
Plus by open sourcing this, I obtain one said goal.

The app starts by itself only during my working hours (throughout the day at least) on working days (eg. 9-5, Mon-Fri) and stops by itself as well.
Once the app starts it will display each photo following the below naming conventions:

```
// extension is irrelevant, just the image<number> is important
image1.webp
image2.jpg
image3.png
```

which can be added to the following path 

`app\src\main\res\drawable-nodpi\`

Feel free to pull and edit as you please. I wont be releasing this app to the store nor do I have the intention of improving the app.
It does its job for me, maybe it can for you too.
